<h2>Technology</h2>
<a name="rsync"></a>
<h3>Why don't you just use rsync?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>rsync is a one-way syncing protocol. This means that if you have two servers and delete a file on one side, it will pop up again if you use rsync. To ensure old files get removed but new files added, and updated files overwritten, you need a N-to-N sync solution. ownCloud uses csync for syncing, which also deals with conflicts in a smart way.</li>
</ul>
<a name="language"></a>
<h3>Why is ownCloud written in PHP and not in my favorite language?</h3>
ownCloud is for everybody. We picked PHP because:
<ul>
	<li>PHP runs anywhere and is supported everywhere. Even the cheapest hosting provider should support ownCloud and PHP makes that possible.</li>
	<li>PHP is easy to learn which makes it easy for people to contribute. The ease of PHP also allows you to check the code that runs your ownCloud and make changes that you need.</li>
</ul>
In short, PHP lowers the barrier for using, auditing, modifying and contributing to ownCloud. And that is important!<br />
See more details in <a href="http://karlitschek.de/2014/10/a-possible-future-for-php/" target="_blank">this blog by ownCloud founder Frank Karlitschek</a>.
<a name="protocol"></a>
<h3>Why do you use HTTP and not $PROTOCOL?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>HTTP goes through every firewall and proxy.</li>
</ul>
<a name="android"></a>
<h3>Why does the calendar/contacts app not work with Android?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>iOS has native ical/caldav support, Android does not. You have to use an Android app that does but unfortunately almost all apps we're aware of that support caldav/ical are paid. One open source client is <a href="https://github.com/rfc2822/davdroid" target="_blank">DAVdroid</a>. You can find a list of <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Apps" target="_blank">3rd-party apps which work with ownCloud here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="mobilefeatures"></a>
<h3>Why does the Android/iOS mobile app not support my favorite feature?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Android mobile app has automatic picture and video upload. Both mobile clients and give access to your files and include selective sync for keeping some of your files up to date on the device. Other features are under development or provided by other apps (like calendar and contacts, see <a href="#android">previous FAQ item</a>). If you'd like to add features to the Android or iOS client, find the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/android/" target="_blank">Android sources here</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/ios">iOS sources here</a>. Legal notes: the Android app is under the GPLv2, the iOS app under the GPLv3. To contribute to either, you have to <a href="https://owncloud.org/contribute/agreement/">sign a contributor agreement</a> or contribute your code under the <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">MIT license</a>. For testing, we provide a <a href="https://owncloud.org/contribute/iOS-license-exception/">iOS license exception</a> so you can run the iOS app on up to 100 devices.</li>
</ul>
<a name="security"></a>
<h3>How Secure is ownCloud?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ownCloud supports HTTPS and offers server-side encryption. ownCloud automatically generates a 4096-bit strong private/public key-pair for each user. Private keys are encrypted with the userâ€™s login password.</li>
	<li>ownCloud is an open source project so all code is visible. We are committed to building secure code. We employ a full-time security expert and do regular security audits on the code. We always welcome fixes to security issues, see <a href="https://owncloud.org/security" target="_blank">owncloud.org/security</a>.</li>
	<li>To learn a bit more about ownCloud security, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLJbMrLgowk&index=25&list=PLtZe22ggl2YCfEzrHbFCylXGLGYtsHm96" target="_blank">this technical talk at the ownCloud Contributor Conference</a> and read <a href="https://owncloud.org/blog/how-owncloud-uses-encryption-to-protect-your-data/" target="_blank">this article about encryption</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="encryption"></a>
<h3>Are files encrypted during sync?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, we use TLS for sending and receiving files over the network so they are encrypted during transmission.</li>
</ul>
<a name="encryption2"></a>
<h3>Does ownCloud support encrypting files on the server?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, but the Encryption app is designed to protect your data on external storage, rather than on the server ownCloud runs on. In the current design, the server always has the keys to the data. They are encrypted by your password, but you can't trust that it is as secure as client-side encryption. ownCloud does not do client-side encryption because you can not have a web interface if the server can't read the files and the web interface (and sharing abilities!) are very central to ownCloud. So you will always need to be able to trust the server if you want to 'own' your data. Read more <a href="https://owncloud.org/blog/how-owncloud-uses-encryption-to-protect-your-data/" target="_blank">in this article</a>.</li>
	<li>If you really want client-side encryption, we recommend you look for other solutions. Of course, if you are sufficiently knowledgeable and skilled, you would be more than welcome to improve on the file encryption technology. If you are interested in supporting or working on this feature, check out <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/issues/275" target="_blank">github</a> for the latest state on the discussion about it and check out <a href="http://owncloud.org/contribute">owncloud.org/contribute</a> to get started.</li>
</ul>
<a name="conflict"></a>
<h3>Why do I sometimes get conflict files and messages while syncing?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A conflict may be caused by two or more users editing the same files at the same time or while on the road before the files are synced. We do not merge changes to files like version control systems like git do; we don't modify user files, ever. So you will get two files, the one that was synced to the server first and the one you had locally modified in the same time. You can compare the file changes by hand and delete the local file once you're sure you did not lose data.</li>
</ul>
<a name="partialsyncing"></a>
<h3>Does ownCloud use partial file syncing (only syncing changes, like only meta data of a movie)?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>We introduced chunked, parallel up- and download with ownCloud 7 and the ownCloud 1.6 client. Syncing only file changes needs much deeper changes. It is on our roadmap, but won't be done soon. If you want to speed it up and work on it, see <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/issues/179" target="_blank">the github discussion</a>. If you really want this feature and would like to specifically fund work on it, see <a href="https://www.bountysource.com/issues/905030-sync-only-the-file-change-not-entire-file" target="_blank">the Bountysource page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="deduplication"></a>
<h3>Does ownCloud do file de-duplication?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>No, we think that that is the job of the file system. We do maintain versions of files as they are replaced and you may revert to older versions at any time.</li>
</ul>
<a name="syncspeed"></a>
<h3>Why is ownCloud syncing not faster?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The design of ownCloud is constrained by two important features: scalability and reliability.
	<ul>
		<li>ownCloud is designed to be very scalable, and be independent of the used storage system. We want it to work with terabytes of data and tens of thousands of users - and it does, organizations like CERN in Switzerland and German universities run ownCloud with such amounts of data and users. The downside of this is that it is hard use 'checksums' to see if files are changed: imagine doing that on terabytes of data on an external storage! What is fast for a few gigabyte or a few thousand files is would break entirely once you add a large movie- or music database, or start pumping scientific data through the system.</li>
		<li>A second design goal of ownCloud is reliability. We would rather be slower, but ensure no files are lost, than risk going fast-and-loose with user data. For example, the file-change-notifications on Linux and Windows are not 100% reliable in all cases, so just-to-be-sure we run a full file system scan every few minutes. Yes, that eats battery life, but it does ensure you do not lose any of your files!</li>
	</ul>
	This does not mean there is no room for improvement, we work very hard to make ownCloud faster and every release introduces many performance improvements. Also, help is always welcome. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/mirall/" target="_blank">client code on github</a> if you are interested in the challenges of fast, scalable and reliable file syncing!

</ul>
<a name="closedapps"></a>
<h3>Can I write closed source apps for ownCloud?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Yes, but only under the ownCloud Enterprise Edition, which supports integration with proprietary technologies.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ownCloud Community</h2>
<a name="communitylocation"></a>
<h3>Where is the ownCloud community hosted?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The ownCloud code can be found at <a href="http://github.com/owncloud" target="_blank">github.com/ownCloud</a> and our website is on <a href="http://owncloud.org" target="_blank">owncloud.org</a></li>
</ul>
<a name="communitysize"></a>
<h3>How big is the ownCloud Community?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ownCloud has over 1.8 million users and over 300 programmers contributed code in the last 12 months. Tens of thousands participate on our forums, mailing lists, translation and documentation tools, and IRC channels in testing, discussions, translation, documentation and so on. See <a href="http://blog.jospoortvliet.com/2014/08/owncloud-numbers.html" target="_blank">this blog</a> for an analysis and dig into the statistics <a href="http://owncloud.org/blog/announcing-owncloud-community-statistics-provided-by-bitergia/" target="_blank">on Bitergia</a> so you can judge the health of our community yourself.</li>
</ul>
<a name="howitstarted"></a>
<h3> How did ownCloud get started?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>ownCloud started with a keynote by Frank Karlitschek at Camp KDEâ€™10 where he talked about the need of a self-controlled free and open source cloud. Two years later, Frank announced the start of ownCloud Inc. which is headquartered in Lexington, Massachusetts in the United States and Nuremburg, Germany. Find out more on <a href="http://owncloud.org/history" target="_blank">owncloud.org/history</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="getinvolved"></a>
<h3>How can I get involved in the ownCloud Community?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The best way to get started is to visit <a href="http://owncloud.org/contribute" target="_blank">owncloud.org/contribute</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="notechknowledge"></a>
<h3>But what if I'm not very technical?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There are lots of ways you can contribute to ownCloud. We have a need for developers, designers, event organizers, speakers, QA and more. It is all <a href="http://owncloud.org/contribute" target="_blank">on the 'contribute' page</a>!</li>
</ul>
<a name="appslocation"></a>
<h3> Where can I find ownCloud apps?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>There is a large selection of build in and community-approved apps available for download from within the App management screen in your ownCloud installation. Featuring apps like the Music app, the Calendar app and so on you can watch your movies, share your pictures and keep your bookmarks synced. Download is seamless (just 'enable' the app and wait while it is downloaded, installed and enabled) and upgrading is easy from the same screen.</li>
	<li>If the build in and approved apps are not enough, you can get more than 200 community and enterprise-developed ownCloud apps at <a href="http://apps.owncloud.com/" target="_blank">apps.owncloud.com</a> that have been developed with our open API. You can find apps in all categories: multimedia, PIM, productivity, games, tools and more. Note that unlike the apps available for download from the App Management screen in ownCloud, the apps on <a href="http://apps.owncloud.com/" target="_blank">apps.owncloud.com</a> are not extensively checked for safety and compatibility, so you should be careful with them. For this reason, we do not support automatic download and installation for these, but require users to download the apps and install them in their ownCloud by hand.</li>
	<li>If you are looking for third-party apps that integrate ownCloud in mobile and desktop applications, see our <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/core/wiki/Apps" target="_blank">3rd-party apps</a> page.</li>
	<li>Building a new ownCloud app is easy. If you're interested in developing your own ownCloud app, see <a href="http://owncloud.org/contribute/" target="_blank">the contribute page</a>, where you can find a link to the latest App Development documentation.</li>
</ul>
<h2>ownCloud for the Enterprise</h2>
<a name="entcomparison"></a>
<h3>How do the Community and Enterprise compare?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The Community Edition which you can get from <a href="http://owncloud.org/install" target="_blank">owncloud.org</a> is perfect for home users and small businesses. This edition is optimized for stand alone functionality. It comes with a large number of supported apps (see the ownCloud apps question) and offers a fast release cycle and community support.</li>
	<li>The Enterprise Edition available for purchase from <a href="http://owncloud.com" target="_blank">owncloud.com</a> is perfect for medium and large enterprises. This edition is optimized for reliability, scalability and integration in an enterprise environment. It comes with enterprise certified applications, as well as integration with enterprise services like Sharepoint, Oracle SQL and SAML/Shibboleth authentication and audit and control tools. ownCloud Inc. offers enterprise support, deployment tools and consulting.</li>
	<li>You can find a comparison table of Community and Enterprise features on <a href="https://owncloud.com/lp/community-or-enterprise/" target="_blank">this page</a>.</li>
</ul>
<a name="bestedition"></a>
<h3>Which Edition is best for me?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>As home or small business user, you benefit from the rich functionality of the Community Edition. Many apps you'd want in a home or small office situation like the Music player, Calendar, Contacts, Mail, Password Manager and so on are available for this edition.</li>
	<li>As a general rule, with more than 50 users and large amounts of data, Enterprise Edition becomes a better choice. While more conservative in offered features and certified apps, it integrates better with services used in a typical enterprise and comes with 12x5 or 24x7 global support, a dedicated Deployment Manager and more.</li>

</ul>
<a name="communityandenterprise"></a>
<h3>How do the Community and Enterprise work together?</h3>
<ul>
	<li>The company makes it possible for developers to work full time on ownCloud, organizing ownCloud events, marketing ownCloud to a wider audience and supporting companies, governments and schools in their ownCloud deployments.</li>
	<li>The business model of ownCloud Inc. is very similar to other successful Open Source companies, offering services and support around ownCloud for the enterprise. The company is dedicated to working entirely in the open, accelerating development in the areas of its customers' needs while enabling a completely open development process where everybody can contribute.</li>
	<li>The Enterprise Edition is built off the same code as the Community Edition. It adds integration with some proprietary enterprise services like Sharepoint, which are relevant for our big customers. ownCloud does development in the open; this is neither an open-core nor a dump-your-code-over-the-wall model. Read what the Free Software Foundation says about it: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions.html" target="_blank">gnu.org/philosophy/selling-exceptions</a>.</li>
