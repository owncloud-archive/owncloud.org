			<h2>Bring ownCloud to conferences and trade shows</h2>
		<p>As ownCloud appeals to both home users and businesses, we can be found at a wide variety of conferences and trade shows.
			To spread the word, you can either give a talk or workshop, or organize a booth.</p>
		<ul>

			<li><strong>Give a presentation or workshop</strong><br />
			If you want to give a presentation or workshop on ownCloud, you can get some ideas for subjects and slides <a  target="_blank" href="https://github.com/owncloud/promo">here</a>.
			There is also a presentation templates which you can adapt to your needs.</li>

			<li><strong>Organize a booth</strong><br />
			Going to a trade show or conference for ownCloud is not hard. All you need are a few volunteers and some positive energy! Read the steps below to learn how to organize a booth.
			<ul>

				<li><em>Get the booth!</em><br />
				Work out a booth space with the organization of the event.<br />
				Now, get some people together who can help and arrange travel, hotel and all that! Before the event, try to print some of our
				<a  target="_blank" href="https://github.com/owncloud/promo">promo materials</a> and see <em>Resources</em> above for ordering some things from us.</li>

				<li><em>Tell everybody about the booth!</em><br />
				Once you've secured a spot, share the ownCloud attendance to the event over social media -
				perhaps even set up an event page on Facebook and Google plus, ask people to share the news. And <a href="https://www.google.com/+JosPoortvliet">tell us about it</a>!</li>

				<li><em>Set up the booth</em><br />
				A crucial thing when setting up a booth is to create open space. This is very hard, as many events put a row of tables in front of the visitors 
				and it is of course easy to go and sit behind them. But that is hardly an effective strategy. Instead, put the table back against the wall if you 
				can, and stand in front. That is much nicer for visitors! Nobody likes to be the first person at a booth, and if you and your booth friends are 
				standing in front, it seems there is always something going on.<br />

				<li><em>Promote the booth</em><br />
				Get people to the booth! You can put some leaflets or hang up some posters around the venue, and if you give a talk you should certainly 
				mention that there is an ownCloud booth.</li>

				<li><em>Handle visitors</em><br />
				There are four kind of visitors you get at the booth: newbies, advanced users, business users and (potential) contributors. You're there to get 
				newbies interested in ownCloud, answer questions of the advanced users and convince the (potential) business users that their company needs 
				ownCloud! Last but not least, you should convince (potential) contributors to get on board with ownCloud hacking: it is fun and easy.<br />
				To help you talk about ownCloud, we have a <a  target="_blank" href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/files/FAQ.pdf">conference team FAQ</a> and
				some <a  target="_blank" href="<?php echo get_template_directory_uri(); ?>/assets/files/TalkingPoints.pdf">conference talking points</a>. Print these pages,
				read them and bring them for the others on the booth to read in a quiet moment. Of course, you can use our flyers, posters and other materials. You 
				can <a  target="_blank" href="https://github.com/owncloud/promo">download designs here</a> for printing. You can also find our logo there. Please do follow the usage guidelines on that page.</li>
			
				<li><strong><em>Tips</em></strong><br />
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Approach people with a question</strong>. For example: <ul><li><em>"do you know ownCloud?"</em></li> <li><em>"do you use dropbox or Google drive?"</em></li> <li><em>"do you share files and work on them with other people?"</em></li></ul>
					Your goal is to find out what their problem is and then tell them how ownCloud can help them. If they have no problem or ownCloud can't help, well, that's it. 
					No reason to make them listen to anything they won't be interested in, while you could be talking to people who DO need ownCloud!</li>

					<li><strong>Organize little talks or workshops at the booth</strong>. Like <em>"building your first ownCloud app"</em> or <em>"installing ownCloud on a RaspberryPi"</em>.
					They might not attract a large audience, but that means you get 
					to spend some quality time with a few interested ownCloud users or potential contributors!</li>

					<li><strong>If you encounter negativity or users with problems</strong>, of course try to help them. But don't spend too much time on it - rather, ask them to ask on the forums 
					or on the mailing list. You sure won't be able to solve their complicated problem on the spot and there are lots of other people who want to hear about 
					ownCloud. Nothing is perfect, neither is ownCloud - but we are best at dealing with that online, rather than at events.</li>

					<li><strong>Don't hack at the booth</strong> unless you are giving a workshop. It makes it seem very uninviting.</li>
				
					<li><strong>Have a screen with ownCloud in action</strong> at the booth. You can demo ownCloud easily that way, or let people play with
					<a  target="_blank" href="http://demo.owncloud.com">demo.owncloud.com</a>. And have something 'interesting' happen while you are not doing a demo.
					A video of ownCloud in action, for example. You can find some in our <a  target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/ownclouders">YouTube channel</a>.</li>
