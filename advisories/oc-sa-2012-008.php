        <h2>Insufficiently random values (oC-SA-2012-008)</h2>
        <p>10th August 2012</p>
        <p>Risk level: <strong>Low</strong></p>
        
        
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><p>The rand and mt_rand functions in PHP < 5.4.x do not produce cryptographically strong random numbers, which allows attackers to leverage exposures in products that rely on these functions for security-relevant functionality, as demonstrated by the password-reset functionality in ownCloud 4.0.x.</p>
</p>
        <h3>Affected Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ownCloud Server &lt; <strong>4.0.8</strong> (CVE-2008-4107)</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Action Taken</h3>
        <p><p>It is recommended that all instances are upgraded to ownCloud Server 4.0.8.</p>
</p>
        <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
