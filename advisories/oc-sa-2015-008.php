        <h2>Command injection when using external SMB storage (oC-SA-2015-008)</h2>
        <p>24th June 2015</p>
        <p>Risk level: <strong>High</strong></p>
        <p>CVSS v2 Base Score: 9 (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C)">AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:C/I:C/A:C</a>)</p>
        <p>CWE: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/78.html">Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection') (CWE-78)</a></p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><p>The external SMB storage of ownCloud was not properly neutralizing all special elements which allows an adversary to execute arbitrary SMB commands.</p>
<p>This was caused by improperly sanitizing the ; character which is interpreted as command separator by smbclient (the used software to connect to SMB shared by ownCloud)</p>
<p>Effectively this allows an attacker to gain access to any file on the system or overwrite it, finally leading to a PHP code execution in the case of ownCloud's config file.</p>
</p>
        <h3>Affected Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ownCloud Server &lt; <strong>6.0.8</strong> (CVE-2015-4718)</li>
<li>ownCloud Server &lt; <strong>7.0.6</strong> (CVE-2015-4718)</li>
<li>ownCloud Server &lt; <strong>8.0.4</strong> (CVE-2015-4718)</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Action Taken</h3>
        <p><p>Files containing a <code>;</code> are no longer processed on external SMB storages. This is no regression as handling files containing said character was not reliably possible before as well.</p>
<p>ownCloud 8.1 will feature a completely rewritten SMB storage with cleaner code to reduce the attack surface even more.</p>
</p>
