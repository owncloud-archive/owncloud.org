        <h2>Improper authorization checks in files_external (oC-SA-2014-012)</h2>
        <p>24th May 2014</p>
        <p>Risk level: <strong>High</strong></p>
        
        
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><p>Due to not verifying whether an user has been granted access to add external storages an authenticated user could even mount external storage (e.g. SMB/FTP/etc.) without permission.</p>
</p>
        <h3>Affected Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ownCloud Server &lt; <strong>6.0.3</strong> (CVE-2014-3835)</li>
<li>ownCloud Server &lt; <strong>5.0.16</strong> (CVE-2014-3835)</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Action Taken</h3>
        <p><p>We reviewed the access-control of the files_external application and ensured that permissions are checked properly for every action.</p>
<p>Additionally our next major release ownCloud 7 will give administrators the possibility to define which external storage type an user is allowed to mount.</p>
</p>
