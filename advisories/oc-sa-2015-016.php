        <h2>Improper validation of certificates when using self-signed certificates (oC-SA-2015-016)</h2>
        <p>21st September 2015</p>
        <p>Risk level: <strong>Medium</strong></p>
        <p>CVSS v2 Base Score: 6.1 (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2&vector=(AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N)">AV:N/AC:H/Au:N/C:C/I:P/A:N</a>)</p>
        <p>CWE: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/297.html">Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch (CWE-297)</a></p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><p>The ownCloud Desktop Client was vulnerable against MITM attacks until version 2.0.0 in combination with self-signed certificates. To be exploitable e following conditions have to be met:</p><ul><li>The connection to the remote ownCloud server must be secured using a self-signed certificate which the user imported in the ownCloud client.</li><li>The client needs to be compiled with a Qt release greater than 5.3.x (such as 5.4.x)</li><li>If all conditions are met the client send a single HTTP request containing potential secret data such as the Basic Authentication Headers or the ssion ID.</li></ul><p>The issue was caused by calling the incorrect QNetworkReply::ignoreSslErrors overload: Omitting the errors to be ignored as a parameter, Qt's twork stack will ignore all errors. The code is now calling the overloaded version which ignores only the error acknowledged by the user. </p><p>ownCloud highly advises affected users to update affected clients as soon as possible to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Users with such setup and that have experienced such a behaviour are encouraged to change their ownCloud passwords.</p><p>This is a partial regression of oC-SA-2015-009 (CVE-2015-4456).</p></p>
        <h3>Affected Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ownCloud Desktop &lt; <strong>2.0.1</strong> (CVE assignment pending)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Action Taken</h3>
        <p><p>To protect our users ownCloud has issued the 2.0.1 client which addresses this issue. Users of older ownCloud clients are encouraged to import their certificate into the local system trust store.</p></p>
