		<h2>Multiple stored XSS in "documents" application (oC-SA-2015-002)</h2>
		<p>25th March 2015</p>
		<p>Risk level: <strong>Medium</strong></p>
		<h3>Description</h3>
		<p><p>Due to not sanitising all user provided input, the "documents" application shipped with the mentioned ownCloud versions is vulnerable to multiple stored cross-site scripting attacks.<br/>The "documents" application is enabled by default in the ownCloud Community Edition but not shipped with the ownCloud Enterprise Edition.</p><p>Successful exploitation requires that the adversary is able to modify a WebODF document and a victim opens the shared document.</p><p>ownCloud advises browsers to disable inline JavaScript execution due to the used Content-Security-Policy; this vulnerability is therefore not exploitable if you use a browser that supports the current CSP standard. You can check at <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=contentsecuritypolicy">CanIUse.com</a> whether your browser supports our Content-Security-Policy.</p></p>
		<h3>Affected Software</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>ownCloud Server < <strong>7.0.5</strong> (CVE-2015-3012)</li><li>ownCloud Server < <strong>6.0.7</strong> (CVE-2015-3012)</li><li>ownCloud Server < <strong>5.0.19</strong> (CVE-2015-3012)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Action Taken</h3>
		<p><p>The issue was caused by not sanitising a Dojo component in WebODF. These not sanitised parts are now properly sanitised and fixed with WebODF v0.5.5, details can be found at the <a href="https://github.com/kogmbh/WebODF/blob/v0.5.5/ChangeLog.md#fixes-1">WebODF changelog</a>.</p></p>
