        <h2>Improper validation of certificates within the iOS application (oC-SA-2015-012)</h2>
        <p>3rd August 2015</p>
        <p>Risk level: <strong>High</strong></p>
        <p>CVSS v2 Base Score: 7.8 (<a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=2&vector=(AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)">AV:A/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N</a>)</p>
        <p>CWE: <a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/297.html">Improper Validation of Certificate with Host Mismatch (CWE-297)</a></p>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/owncloud/ios-library">ownCloud iOS Library</a> was vulnerable against a remotely exploitable certification problem until version 1.1.2. The vulnerable library version is used by the official ownCloud iOS client until version 3.4.4.</p>
<p>Specifically it has been discovered that the used networking library (<a href="https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/">AFNetworking</a>) is per default not ensuring whether the host-specific data (i.e. the Common Name ("CN") of the certificate) is actually associated with the connected remote host.</p>
<p>This effectively allows MITM (Man-in-the-Middle) attacks, allowing adversaries in such a position to intercept the traffic of the application using the ownCloud iOS Library.</p>
<p>ownCloud highly advises users to update affected clients as soon as possible to ensure data integrity and confidentiality. Third-party developers using the ownCloud iOS Library are encouraged to update the library and provide users with updated client versions.</p>
</p>
        <h3>Affected Software</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>ownCloud Mobile &lt; <strong>iOS 3.4.4</strong> (CVE-2015-3996 (Note: This is the upstream CVE for the responsible AFNetworking issue))</li>

        </ul>
        <h3>Action Taken</h3>
        <p><p>The vulnerable library has been updated.</p>
</p>
        <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
